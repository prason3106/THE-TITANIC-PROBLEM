# THE-TITANIC-PROBLEM
You will have 2 datasets. One dataset is titled train.csv and the other is titled test.csv.  Train.csv will contain the details of a subset of the passengers on board (891 to be exact) and importantly, will reveal whether they survived or not, also known as the “ground truth”.  The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose the “ground truth” for each passenger. It’s your job to predict these outcomes.  Using the patterns you find in the train.csv data, predict whether the other 418 passengers on board (found in test.csv) survived.  This Notebook will show basic examples of: Data Handling Importing Data with Pandas Cleaning Data Exploring Data through Visualizations with Matplotlib  Data Analysis Supervised Machine learning Techniques: Logit Regression Model Plotting results Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 3 kernels Basic Random Forest Plotting results  Valuation of the Analysis K-folds cross validation to valuate results locally Output the results from the IPython Notebook to csv file  Required Libraries: NumPy IPython Pandas SciKit-Learn SciPy StatsModels Patsy Matplotlib
